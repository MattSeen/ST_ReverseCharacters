# Sublime Text Reverse Characters

A simple plugin to answer SO question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28966185/reverse-all-line-of-text-in-sublime-text

## Compatiability

I have only tested this with Sublime Text 3.

## Install

The only install option right now is by using git.

So open Sublime Text and click:

    Perferences -> Browse Packages

And from there you can run the follow line from the command prompt (given that git is install and available in your environment at that time):

    git clone https://github.com/MattSeen/ST_ReverseCharacters

## Usage

Using multiple cursors highlight the different lines of text you want to reverse and then open the command palette and use the command:

    Reverse characters in selected section
